# Heo Jun's Pharmacy
### Motivation and Summary
Created to honor Heo Jun (UNESCO World Individual) in an engaging way.<br />
Includes: minigames such as using acupuncture to cure the Korean people, collecting medicinal herbs, and a mountain spirit quiz.<br />
Aim: to help individuals (particularly youth) learn more about this important figure.

### Methodology
I used Javascript to structure the game, drew and animated the characters and objects myself, and coded for each object. I automated characters using javascript functions.

<br />
Here's one segment of code.
<br />
One of the most time consuming aspects of this project was collecting information, creating dialogue and making sure the dialogue was linked to an object. Without this in the code, the game wouldn't move on to the next scene. 

The attached file is an apk file, so can be run on android. One could also search for "Nox App Player" and install the program on a computer.

### Challenges Faced During Development
Debugging the acupuncture game was most difficult. There were irregularities in displaying self-drawn elements. I altered file formats and file sizes to address the conflict with the interface.

### Next Steps
In the future, I would like to expand the game to incorporate more aspects of history and help illustrate how Heo Jun grew up. I would also like to lengthen the project so it can be published not just on a website.
