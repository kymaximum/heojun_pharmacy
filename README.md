# Heo Jun's Pharmacy
### Motivation and Summary
Motivation/Aim(s): To honor Heo Jun (UNESCO World Individual) in an engaging way.<br />
To help individuals (particularly youth) learn more about this important figure.<br />
Includes: minigames such as using acupuncture to cure the Korean people, collecting medicinal herbs, and a mountain spirit quiz.<br />

### Methodology
I used Javascript to structure the game, drew and animated the characters and objects myself, and coded for each object. I automated characters using javascript functions.
<br />
Here's one segment of code.

The attached file is an apk file, so can be run on android. 
One could also search for "Nox App Player" and install the program on a computer.

### Challenges Faced During Development
Irregularities in displaying self-drawn elements, file format conflicts, interface conflicts. This was a simple coding project focused more on engagement towards a young audience so the programming process was not intended to be technically challenging or complex.

### Next Steps
Expanding the game to incorporate more aspects of history and illustrating how Heo Jun grew up. I would also like to lengthen the project so it can be published not just on a website.
